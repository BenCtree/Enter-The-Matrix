# Enter-The-Matrix

A matrix class in C++ (which also handles vectors - just construct an n x 1 or 1 x n matrix) implementing the usual matrix arithmetic (including a naive O(n^3) matrix multiplication), but also some more interesting stuff, including:

- Gaussian elimination to put a matrix in row eschelon form
- A solver for systems of linear equations
- QR decomposition using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm
- QR algorithm to find eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors
